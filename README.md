# Smart-Miner-Helmet
Mining is one of the most vital yet dangerous industries in the world. Miners often work in harsh and unpredictable environments where they are exposed to hazardous gases, extreme temperatures, high humidity, limited ventilation, and poor visibility. Despite advances in mining technology, the safety of underground workers remains a critical concern, with accidents caused by gas leaks, explosions, heat strokes, and structural failures still being reported frequently. Therefore, there is a growing need for smart, wearable safety systems that can continuously monitor environmental conditions and alert workers and supervisors to potential dangers in real time.
The Smart Miner Helmet project addresses this challenge by designing a compact, intelligent, and cost-effective safety device that miners can wear while working in underground conditions. Built around the powerful and versatile ESP32 microcontroller, the helmet integrates multiple sensors and communication modules to create a comprehensive safety monitoring system. The key objective is to ensure that any dangerous environmental changes are detected early and that immediate alerts are generated to prevent accidents.
The helmet includes MQ2, MQ9, and MQ135 gas sensors to detect the presence of flammable, toxic, and harmful gases such as methane, carbon monoxide, LPG, and general air pollutants. A DHT11 sensor measures temperature and humidity to prevent heat-related risks. The data from these sensors is displayed on an OLED screen in real time, allowing the miner to stay informed of the surrounding conditions. In addition, the values are recorded to an SD card module along with timestamps, creating a historical log of the environmental parameters for analysis and reporting.
To enhance alert mechanisms, buzzers and LEDs are activated when any measured value crosses a predefined safety threshold, warning the miner instantly. The Wi-Fi capability of the ESP32 allows sensor data to be transmitted to a web interface, enabling remote monitoring by safety officers. This real-time data sharing is crucial for supervisors to assess conditions and respond quickly in case of emergencies. An emergency SOS button is also included, which, when pressed, activates the buzzer and sends a distress signal to the web portal.
One of the most advanced features of the helmet is the integration of an ESP32-CAM module, which streams live video footage from the minerâ€™s location. This enables real-time surveillance, providing visual confirmation of the miner's condition and surroundings, which is especially valuable during rescue operations or emergency responses.
